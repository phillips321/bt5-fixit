This tool updates Back|Track 5. It was designed for the gnome32bit version but should run on the other versions.

It adds many of the missing tools and contains an easy updater to update the tools that are already installed.

Just a few of the many tools that are missing that this script gives you the option to add:

RDP client, netwox, netsed, calculator, ssh-keys, missing drivers, arp-scan, gnomeVNC server, UbuntuFirewall, p7zip, screen, file-roller, wifite, open-vas, pyrite.... the list goes on!

+1 the project please!
